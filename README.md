## Core Features

VEDA-MOTRIX AI is a multi-faceted platform designed to revolutionize vehicle maintenance and operational management through the power of artificial intelligence.

- **üß† Simulated Data Analysis**: An AI agent analyzes mock vehicle sensor data to detect anomalies, presenting findings on a master dashboard.
- **üîÆ Failure Prediction**: The AI Diagnosis Agent predicts potential component failures, assigns priority levels, and drives downstream actions for other agents.
- **ü§ù Customer Engagement Simulation**: An AI agent simulates conversations (text/voice) to engage vehicle owners about issues and recommended maintenance.
- **üìÖ Appointment Scheduling**: The scheduling agent suggests available service slots and confirms bookings through a user-friendly UI.
- **üìä Feedback Collection & Analysis**: Post-service feedback is collected and analyzed by an AI, providing sentiment analysis and actionable insights.
- **üè≠ Manufacturing Insights**: An AI agent generates improvement suggestions for Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and Corrective/Preventive Actions (CAPA) based on service data to optimize manufacturing processes.
- **üõ°Ô∏è UEBA Security Monitoring**: A dedicated security agent detects and flags anomalous or unauthorized behavior from other AI agents, ensuring system integrity.

## ü§ñ Key AI Agents

The intelligence of VEDA-MOTRIX is driven by a suite of specialized AI agents working in concert:

- **Data Analysis Agent**: The first line of defense, scanning sensor data for anomalies.
- **Diagnosis & Prediction Agent**: Identifies potential failures and predicts their timeline.
- **Customer Engagement Agent**: Communicates with users in a natural, helpful way.
- **Manufacturing Insights Agent**: Closes the loop by feeding service data back into the production cycle.
- **UEBA Security Agent**: The system's internal affairs, ensuring all other agents behave as expected.

This orchestration allows the platform to move from simple data reporting to a proactive, intelligent, and self-improving operational tool.
